# Daylight Coin

Daylight Coin is a fork of Bitcoin Gold. 

DAYLIGHT COIN is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. 

Daylight coin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Daylight coin Core is the name of open source software which enables the use of this currency. 


Daylight (codename DLT) began as a fork of Daylight after block height 491406 on Tue, 24 Oct 2017 01:17:35 GMT and began being mined as a separate chain at block height 491407 on Sun, 12 Nov 2017 13:34:01 GMT.

The primary goal is to maintain a variant of Daylight that is more decentralized by using an ASIC-resistant Proof of Work algorithm, removing barriers to entry for new miners around the world and reducing the concentration of power in the hands of massive-scale mining operations.

Daylight Gold preserves and implements Daylight features such as SegWit. Significant differences at launch time included:

- ASIC-resistant GPU-minable PoW algorithm (Equihash)
- Per-block difficulty adjustment algorithm
- Replay protection (SIGHASH_FORK_ID)
- Unique wallet addresses (prefixes of G and A)

Although DLT was bootstrapped on 12 Nov to create an entirely new network, it contains the entire Daylight blockchain until block 491406. As a result, Daylight Gold became a full fork with all Daylight transaction history since 2009. Any Daylight wallet address which held Daylight in DLT block 491406 before the fork held an equal number of Daylight Gold in DLT block 491407 after the fork.
